How to get started:

1) Modify the metrix.properties file to reflect your setup
2) Insert the table metrix.sql into your database
3) If needed, make the desired modifications to the source code.
4) Compile the jar using:
	
	/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/javac *.java

5) Create the jar file include mysql connector in classpath:
	jar cvfm MetrixDaemon.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF metrix.properties nki/

6) Run the jar with mysql connector library included in classpath:
	/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/java -cp lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar:. -Dproperties=metrix.properties MetrixDaemon

7) If all correct, the server and watcher service has started and all run folders will be parsed and inserted in the SQL database.

8) Only the clientside has not been fully implemented. Please modify this source file to reflect your needs. 

9) Run MetrixClient with the java binary. Support for multi format object returns, Summary / SummaryCollection POJO or a XML string.

10) Documentation on how to adapt the client side will follow in the future. If you've familiarized yourself with java and this source, 
feel free to contribute code and / or answers.
