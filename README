Metrix - A server / client interface for Illumina Sequencing Metrics.
Metrics are collected by parsing the binary InterOp sequencer statistics.

Currently supports Illumina's HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq formats. 
Tested on HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq.

How to get started:

1) Modify the metrix.properties file to reflect your setup
2) Insert the table metrix.sql into your database
3) If needed, make the desired modifications to the source code.
4) Compile the java files using:
	
	/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/javac *.java

5) Run Metrix with mysql connector library included in classpath:
	/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/java -cp lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar:. -Dproperties=metrix.properties MetrixDaemon

5) If all correct, the server and watcher service has started and all run folders will be parsed and inserted in the SQL database.

6) Only the clientside has not been fully implemented. Please modify this source file to reflect your needs. 

7) Run MetrixClient with the java binary. Support for multi format object returns, Summary / SummaryCollection POJO or a XML string.

8) Documentation on how to adapt the client side will follow in the future. If you've familiarized yourself with java and this source, 
feel free to contribute code and / or answers.


How to use the standalone Metrix application:

1) Modify file metrix.properties to reflect the correct directory containing the illumina run directories.
2) Compile the java files using: 

	/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/javac *.java

3) Run Metrix.java using:

	/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/java Metrix **Insert search term here**

The searchterm will be the string that is used to search in the directory names.
This can be a run identifier, flowcell ID or any character string (minimum length is 3)

----------------
-- Optionally --
----------------

4) On unix systems you can make this available on the command line anywhere on your server via /usr/local/bin)
This has to be achieved via a perl run script (please replace the (directory) paths below):

-------
#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;

system("/[PATH_TO_JAVA_7.0_OR_HIGHER]/bin/java -classpath [Full path to the Metrix directory here] Metrix @ARGV");

-------

5) Symlink this perl script in /usr/local/bin with the desired name.
